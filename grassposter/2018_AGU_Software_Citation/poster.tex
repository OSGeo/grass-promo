% Abstract
%
% GRASS GIS (grass.osgeo.org) is a community-driven geospatial software project
% with a record of being used in scientific publications and research projects
% over three decades. Authors of scientific publications, when using and citing
% GRASS GIS, so far opted for citing either the entire software package, citing
% the most recent review publication associated with GRASS GIS, or citing a
% publication associated with a specific module.
%
% GRASS GIS provides over 500 modules, each with a unique functionality and
% purpose, many with associated scientific publications. In addition to these core
% modules in the GRASS GIS distribution there is a growing number of additional
% add-on modules are being developed, often as part of research work. Until now,
% no automated, software-enabled citation mechanism to cite individual GRASS GIS
% modules, or functions in general was provided due to the lack of a reference
% citation standard for GRASS GIS modules defined within the GRASS GIS community.
%
% We present a new GRASS GIS module g.citation with the aim to provide a
% convenient, concise, and standardized way of citing GRASS GIS and its individual
% modules. The current version of g.citation extracts the relevant information
% from a respective manual page of any given GRASS GIS module and turns this
% semi-structured record into a proper citation in a variety of styles and formats
% with the machine-readable Citation File Format (CFF) currently promising most
% efficiency and expressiveness in storing the information and Citation Style
% Language (CSL) used for formatting citations. The module is now in a prototype
% stage and it is available in the GRASS GIS Addons repository. Future directions
% include using standardized format for storing the citation information together
% with the code and incorporating persistent scientific identifiers such as DOI.
% We are now seeking collaborators and feedback from authors of geospatial
% algorithms who want to share their code and be cited at the same time.
