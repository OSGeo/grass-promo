% Abstract
%
% GRASS GIS (grass.osgeo.org) is an open source software for geospatial analysis,
% remote sensing, general geoprocessing and visualization. It is a
% community-driven project with over 35 years of continuous software development
% based on scientific expertise from many geospatial fields. It is characterized
% by long-term releases, stable APIs, and emphasis on science. GRASS GIS
% distribution strives to provide single integrated environment for 2D and 3D
% raster analysis, image processing, vector data analysis, and spatio-temporal
% data processing. It supports large raster files (billions of cells), vector
% topology, coupling with databases, and 64 bit memory. New code based on recent
% research is typically contributed to GRASS GIS Addons repository. Mature, widely
% used code is then moved to the main code base to maximize integration and
% availability. Whether it is addons or the main code base, code is usually
% maintained by the community and preserved in long term even in cases when the
% original author no longer supports the code. To support the needs of scientists,
% the documentation includes not only links to the source code, its history, and
% its authors, but also links to research papers that describe the algorithms
% implemented in the modules.
%
% Code is not only maintained but also extended and improved. For example,
% watershed and stream extraction using least cost path approach was implemented
% in 1989 and extended for massive datasets in 2011. Similarly, vector topology
% cleaning was introduced in 2002, updated over time and substantially improved in
% 2016. Another example is a solar energy module available since 1993 and
% parallelized in 2017. The current stable version of GRASS GIS 7.4 provides new
% features for geosciences such as temporal framework with temporal algebra for
% large time-series processing, fusion of elevation models from various sensors,
% 3D flows, landform detection, image segmentation, simplified batch processing,
% and integrated Python editor among others. GRASS GIS runs in various
% environments including Linux, Mac, Windows, Docker, Raspberry Pi, and on HPC
% clusters. The modules are written in Python, C, or C++. Besides command line
% interface, GRASS GIS provides a graphical user interface, a Python API, and a C
% API. Interfaces with other languages such as R and Ruby are supplied by
% collaborating communities.

 \item New code based on recent research is typically contributed to GRASS GIS Addons repository.
 \item Mature, widely used code is then moved to the main code base to maximize integration and availability.
 \item Both main code base and Addons maintained by the community.

\block{\blocktitlewrap{Example: Spatio-Temporal Data Analysis}}{

\CustomBlockFontSize

\begin{itemize}
 \item The time dimension was introduced in version 7.0 \citep{Gebbert20141, gebbert2015grass}
 \item Time series accessed as space time datasets and as individual vectors or rasters.
 \item More than 50 modules available to manage, analyze, process, and visualize space time datasets.
 \item More than 100,000 map layers can be now handled efficiently in GRASS GIS.
 \item Used for analysis of the European Climate Assessment \& Dataset ECA\&D \citep{Haylock2008_climate_series}
       and temperate climate zone identification \citep{Gebbert20141}.
 \item New temporal modules (e.g. \gmodule{t.rast.aggregate}) work beside well established \gmodule{r.series} module
       and specialized modules such as \gamodule{r.hants} implemented according to \cite{roerink2000reconstructing} or \gamodule{r.seasons}.
 \item Raster and vector temporal algebra can be used for tasks
       such as computing hydrothermal coefficient for a time series of climate data using the actual mathematical formula
       \citep{leppelt2015grass}.

\begin{itemize}
 \item \gamodule{r.smooth.seg} was created by Alfonso Vitti \citep{vitti2008free, vitti2012mumford} and implemented a piece-wise smooth approximation of the original image which can be used to reduce noise in the original image.
% according to \cite{mumford1989optimal} and \cite{march1997variational}
 \item \gmodule{r.clump} for grouping pixels with the same integer values available since 1980s.
       The latest version of \gmodule{r.clump} supports multiple image bands and clumping of floating point values.
 \item Eric Momsen implemented region-growing image segmentation in 2012.
       Markus Metz then extended and optimized the code resulting in the inclusion of the \gmodule{i.segment} module into version 7.0.
       This replaced a multi-resolution classification module of the same name from 1992 \citep{zhuang1992image}.
 \item \gamodule{i.segment.hierarchical} by Pietro Zambelli is based on \gmodule{i.segment} and performs parallelized hierarchical segmentation.
 \item Rashad Kanavath and Markus Metz implemented SLIC Superpixels segmentation \citep{achanta2010epfl, achanta2012slic} in 2016 as \gmodule{i.superpixels.slic}.
