	abstract = "Abstract Time in geographic information systems has been a research theme for more than two decades, resulting in comprehensive theoretical work, many research prototypes and several working solutions. However, none of the available solutions provides the ability to manage, analyze, process and visualize large environmental spatio-temporal datasets and the investigation and assessment of temporal relationships between them. We present in this paper a freely available field based temporal GIS (TGRASS) that fulfills these requirements. Our approach is based on the integration of time in the open source Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS). We introduce the concept of a space time dataset that is defined as a collection of time stamped raster, voxel or vector data. A dedicated set of spatio-temporal tools was implemented to manage, process and analyze space time datasets and their temporal and spatial relationships. We demonstrate the temporal GIS and environmental modeling capabilities of TGRASS by analyzing a multi-decadal European climate dataset.",

    abstract = {{We present a European land-only daily high-resolution gridded data set for precipitation and minimum, maximum, and mean surface
                     temperature for the period 1950â€“2006. This data set improves on previous products in its spatial resolution and extent, time
                     period, number of contributing stations, and attention to finding the most appropriate method for spatial interpolation of
                     daily climate observations. The gridded data are delivered on four spatial resolutions to match the grids used in previous
                     products as well as many of the rotated pole Regional Climate Models (RCMs) currently in use. Each data set has been designed
                     to provide the best estimate of grid box averages rather than point values to enable direct comparison with RCMs. We employ
                     a three-step process of interpolation, by first interpolating the monthly precipitation totals and monthly mean temperature
                     using three-dimensional thin-plate splines, then interpolating the daily anomalies using indicator and universal kriging for
                     precipitation and kriging with an external drift for temperature, then combining the monthly and daily estimates. Interpolation
                     uncertainty is quantified by the provision of daily standard errors for every grid square. The daily uncertainty averaged
                     across the entire region is shown to be largely dependent on the season and number of contributing observations. We examine
                     the effect that interpolation has on the magnitude of the extremes in the observations by calculating areal reduction factors
                     for daily maximum temperature and precipitation events with return periods up to 10 years.
