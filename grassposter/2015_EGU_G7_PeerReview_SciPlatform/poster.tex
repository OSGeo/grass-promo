\block{\blocktitlewrap{Introduction}}
{
\setlength{\parskip}{0.3ex}

Over the last decades, GIS has become a key driver in geospatial science, research and application.
GIS software which is licensed under a free and open source software (FOSS) licence
is more than just a mere tool for spatial analysis.

GRASS GIS (Neteler et al., 2012 \cite{neteler2012grass}), a free and open source GIS,
is used by many scientists directly or as a backend in other projects
such as R or QGIS to perform geoprocessing tasks.

Thanks to the user and developer community, submitted code is evaluated
in different fields of application beyond
the field of expertise of the original authors, and different scales of magnitude
of data.
This exceeds the established review process for scientific writing in a given journal
or a data publication in a defined field of science.

Immediate access to the software repository enables instant quality checking
of the current software version both by continuous automated tests (Petras, 2014 \cite{Petras2014}),
and code review by human experts.

New scientific algorithms can be developed against the reviewed functionalities
already provided by the GRASS GIS codebase.
This avoids unnecessary overheads, by re-implementation,
ensures quality by use of trusted components and allows reuse and long term preservation
within the project software repository.
Integrating scientific algorithms into GRASS GIS helps to preserve reproducibility
of scientific results over time as the original author designed it
(Rocchini \& Neteler, 2012 \cite{rocchini2012let}).

Jasiewicz and Stepinski \cite{jasiewicz2013geomorphons} developed a method and module \gamodule{r.geomorphon}
which provide orientation-invariant and relief-invariant method to classify landforms
in a scale-independent way.

The wildfire simulation toolset, originally developed by Xu (1994~\cite{xu1994simulating})

modules \gmodule{r.ros} and \gmodule{r.spread} and is object of active research. It has been extensively 
tested and recently adapted to European fuel types (Rodriguez-Aseretto et al.,
2013~\cite{rodriguez2013data}; de Rigo et al., 2013~\cite{derigo2013architecture};

\block{\blocktitlewrap{GRASS GIS as Temporal GIS}}{
The time dimension was introduced in GRASS GIS version 7 for raster, 3D raster and
vector map layers, transforming it into a full featured temporal GIS (Gebbert and Pebesma, 2014 \cite{Gebbert20141}).
Time series of map layers are managed in space time datasets, a new data type in GRASS GIS.
Based on the GRASS GIS Temporal Framework, more than 45 modules were implemented to manage, analyze, process
and visualize space time datasets. The temporal enabled GRASS GIS is capable of efficiently
handling more than 100,000 map layers; e.g., it was used to analyze the
European Climate Assessment \& Dataset ECA\&D (Haylock et al. \cite{Haylock2008_climate_series})
for climate change indicators.

\block{\blocktitlewrap{Natural Hazards: Water, Floods and Erosion}}{

GRASS GIS entails several modules that constitute the result of active research on natural hazards.
The \gmodule{r.sim.water} simulation model (Mitas and Mitasova, 1998 \cite{Mitas1998b})
for overland flow with spatially variable rainfall excess conditions was integrated into the Emergency
Routing Decision Planning system as a WPS (Raghavan et al., 2014 \cite{raghavan2014deploying}).
The module \gmodule{r.sim.water} together with
the module \gmodule{r.sim.sediment} for erosion-deposition modeling
implements a path sampling algorithm which is robust and easy to parallelize.
The \gmodule{r.sim.water} module was also utilized by Petrasova et al., 2014 \cite{Petrasova2014} and is now part of
\emph{Tangible Landscape}, a tangible GIS system, which also incorporated \gmodule{r.damflood},
a dam break inundation simulation \cite{cannata2012two}.

\block{\blocktitlewrap{Spatial interpolation}}{
The module \gmodule{v.surf.rst} for spatial interpolation was developed approximately 20 years
ago, since then it has been improved several times \cite{tracvsurfrst}. It is now an important part
of GRASS GIS and is even taught at geospatial modeling courses, for example at North Carolina State University
\cite{ncsugis582}.

\block{\blocktitlewrap{Evapotranspiration (ET)}}{
With the various types of actual ET models being developed in the last 20 years, 
it becomes necessary to inter-compare methods. Most already published ETa model 
comparisons address a low number of models, and small to medium areas 
(Chemin, 2014 \cite{chemin2012distributed}; Gao and Long, 2008 \cite{gao2008intercomparison}; 
Garcia et al., 2007 \cite{garcia2007comparison}; Suleiman et al., 2008
\cite{suleiman2008intercomparison}; Timmermans et al., 2007 \cite{timmermans2007intercomparison}). 
With the large amount of remote sensing data covering the Earth, and the daily 
information available for more than twelve years (i.e. Aqua/Terra-MODIS) for each pixel 
location, it becomes paramount to have a more complete comparison, 
in space and time.

\bigskip

To address this new experimental requirement, a distributed computing framework was 
designed and created (Chemin, 2012 \cite{chemin2012distributed}). 
The architecture design was built from original satellite datasets to various levels 
of processing until reaching the input dataset requirements of various ETa models. 
Each input product is computed once and reused in all ETa models requiring such input. 
This permits standardization of inputs as much as possible to reduce variations of 
models to their own internals/specificities. % can this sentence be rephrased 
All of the ET models are available in the 
new GRASS GIS version 7 as imagery modules and replicability is complete for future 
research.

\block{\blocktitlewrap{Landscape structure}}{
A set of modules for multiscale analysis of landscape structure was added in 1992 
by Baker et al. \cite{baker1992r}, who developed the \gmodulenolink{r.le} model similar to 
FRAGSTATS \cite{mcgarigal1995fragstats}, see manual. The modules were gradually 
improved to become \gmodule{r.li} in 2006. Further development continued, with a significant 
increase in speed \cite{tracrli} and a new interactive user interface.
Rocchini et al. \cite{rocchini2013calculating} used \gmodule{r.li} modules to implement
high level tool for calculating landscape diversity.
