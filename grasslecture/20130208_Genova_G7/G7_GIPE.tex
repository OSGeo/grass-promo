\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Overview}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Overview}

Remote Sensing has been a limited topic in GRASS
\newline\linebreak

\begin{itemize}
 \item GRASS 5: Raw images (esp. aerial photos)
 \item 1990s Public: AVHRR (1100x1100m)
 \item 2000s Public: MODIS (250x250m)
 \item 2010s Public: Landsat (30x30m)
\end{itemize}

Rekindled strong interest from the geospatial community.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Imagery}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Imagery Functionality}

Remote sensing preparation and product generation\\
Increased interest in the recent years.\\
\bigskip
\begin{itemize}
    \item GRASS 6 (stable) has 33 imagery modules
    \item GRASS 7 (experimental) has 46 modules + 1
    \item Add-ons incubating (many!)
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
Modules also have development stages, \\
from experimental (add-ons) to stable (main).
\newline\linebreak
% From Grass 6 (stable) to Grass 7 (experimental).

GRASS 7 has new temporal and spatial analysis algorithms.
