In June 2012 the USGS stopped shipping the csv file we were
parsing (bulletin.asc). As a replacement there are some XML and
JSON versions, or these two same-but-different .csv files:

Mag >= 2.5 for the last week:
  http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/catalogs/eqs7day-M2.5.txt

  # empty version & number of reporting stations (NST) fields, but better
  #  location description
  http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/csv/2.5/week

("all" earthquakes >= M0 are avail for download too, but the files get
big and the relevance gets small)

column headings:
   Src,EqId,Version,Datetime,Lat,Lon,Magnitude,Depth,NST,Region
