Following this, select the 3rd icon from the left on
the GRASS toolbar. This will open the GRASS processing tool as shown
(mostly) in the next three pages. This GRASS tool is a thin
representation of the GRASS GIS capacities, but it will serve the
purpose of this introduction. It comes with a browser of the GRASS
mapset used. It also acts as a data management interface. Fig.~\ref{fig:qgis030}

The GRASS modules available are listed in the next two pages. More are
being ported everyday, The actual number of GRASS GIS modules exceeds
400, you can see that there is still some work to do, and the community
of volunteers are working on it Fig.~\ref{fig:qgis032} Fig.~\ref{fig:qgis033}

\subsection{GRASS PLUGIN PROCESSING}

Let us create some buffers... Select buffering of vectors from the
Modules list. It should looks like this. Choose 500 meters buffer
size Fig.~\ref{fig:qgis034}

%\setkeys{Gin}{width=1\textwidth}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
   \centering

   %label of the figure, which has to correspond to \ref{}:

\end{figure}

Processing is going on... Fig.~\ref{fig:qgis035}

%\setkeys{Gin}{width=1\textwidth}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
   \centering
   %name of your graphic, without the path AND in PNG (screnshots etc)/PDF (drawings) format:

   %caption of the figure
   \caption{}
   %label of the figure, which has to correspond to \ref{}:
   \label{fig:qgis035}
\end{figure}

Finishing the processing Fig.~\ref{fig:qgis036}

%\setkeys{Gin}{width=1\textwidth}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
   \centering
   %name of your graphic, without the path AND in PNG (screnshots etc)/PDF (drawings) format:

   %caption of the figure
   \caption{}
   %label of the figure, which has to correspond to \ref{}:
   \label{fig:qgis036}
\end{figure}

Result should look like this (you have to load the map yourself!) Fig.~\ref{fig:qgis037}

%\setkeys{Gin}{width=1\textwidth}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
   \centering
   %name of your graphic, without the path AND in PNG (screnshots etc)/PDF (drawings) format:

   %caption of the figure
   \caption{}
   %label of the figure, which has to correspond to \ref{}:
   \label{fig:qgis037}
\end{figure}

Now create another buffer from streams but this time at 100 meters...
Like this Fig.~\ref{fig:qgis038}

%\setkeys{Gin}{width=1\textwidth}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
   \centering
   %name of your graphic, without the path AND in PNG (screnshots etc)/PDF (drawings) format:

   \caption{}
   %label of the figure, which has to correspond to \ref{}:
   \label{fig:qgis038}
\end{figure}

Now we are going to subtract the 100m buffer to the 500m buffer, because
we want to exclude the streams and its proximity from our area of
selection. Find this module! Fig.~\ref{fig:qgis039}

meters from the streams. Fig.~\ref{fig:qgis041}
