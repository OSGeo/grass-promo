Note to translators:
this is a new version of the GRASS GIS flyer. The format is svg, you can view the file with a graphics editor like Inkscape.

English, french, and partially italian versions are already achieved. You are very welcome to add your translator's contributions !

Dealing with graphics files is not as easy to handle as editing classical localization files. Fortunately SVG is an application of XML, supporting its formalism and the UTF-8 character set, thus quite well adapted to textual editing.

In order to preserve the original document settings, I think it would be better to avoid editing the file from within e.g. Inkscape, but rather add translated chains through a text editor, or better via a dedicated solution like OmegaT[1]. It provides a rather convenient/intuitive GUI to access strings to translate.                 

The two-sided document is given a certain page layout. Text blocks are not much expandable : please when translating keep in mind this constraint and try to be as concise as english (I know it's a bit challenging).
