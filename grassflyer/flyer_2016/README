Note to translators

by Vincent Bain

This is a new version of the GRASS GIS flyer. The format is svg, you can view the file with a graphics editor like Inkscape.

English, French, and partially Italian versions are already achieved. You are very welcome to add your translator's contributions !

Dealing with graphics files is not as easy to handle as editing classical localization files. Fortunately SVG is an application
of XML, supporting its formalism and the UTF-8 character set, thus quite well adapted to textual editing.

In order to preserve the original document settings, I think it would be better to avoid editing the file from within e.g. Inkscape, but
rather add translated chains through a text editor, or better via a dedicated solution like OmegaT[1].
It provides a rather convenient/intuitive GUI to access strings to translate.

The two-sided document is given a certain page layout. Text blocks are not much expandable : please when translating keep in mind
this constraint and try to be as concise as English (I know it's a bit challenging).
