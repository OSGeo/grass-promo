Note to translators

by Vincent Bain

This is a new version of the GRASS GIS flyer. The format is svg, you can view the file with a graphics editor like Inkscape.

English, French, and partially Italian versions are already achieved. You are very welcome to add your translator's contributions !

Dealing with graphics files is not as easy to handle as editing classical localization files. Fortunately SVG is an application
of XML, supporting its formalism and the UTF-8 character set, thus quite well adapted to textual editing.

In order to preserve the original document settings, I think it would be better to avoid editing the file from within e.g. Inkscape, but
rather add translated chains through a text editor, or better via a dedicated solution like OmegaT[1].
It provides a rather convenient/intuitive GUI to access strings to translate.

The two-sided document is given a certain page layout. Text blocks are not much expandable : please when translating keep in mind
this constraint and try to be as concise as English (I know it's a bit challenging).

How to turn the .svg source file to a .pdf output document [*N?X users]
[- if you did not follow the previous recommendations, and edited the source file from within Inkscape, please make sure /both/ "recto" and "verso" layers are visible ]

- open a terminal in the right directory then convert each layer to pdf [you need to have inkscape package installed]
	inkscape grass_flyer.svg -A grassflyerr.pdf -i layer6 -j
	inkscape grass_flyer.svg -A grassflyerv.pdf -i layer7 -j

- gather these files in a single one [you need to have texlive-extra-utils package installed, perhaps some other tools do the job, don't know]
	pdfjam grassflyerr.pdf grassflyerv.pdf --papersize '{29.7cm,21cm}'

- rename the latter, and you're done
	rm grassflyerr.pdf grassflyerv.pdf 
	mv grassflyerv-pdfjam.pdf grass_flyer.pdf
